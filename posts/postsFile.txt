# Place possible posts for the script to select from here. There should be one per line. If you have 'multi-line' posts, write "\n" where you want your line breaks to be.
# The script will ignore any empty lines, as well as lines that are 'commented' out with a "#".
# It is up to you to ensure that each post is at maximum 300 characters long.
# To include images, begin a line with "getImage[url]". url should directly link to an image, and should not be enclosed in quotes. You can repeat this for up to four times at the beginning of a line, one per image.
